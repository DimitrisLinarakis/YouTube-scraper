# YouTube-scraper
This tool enables its users to extract public data from YouTube channels and calculate, through a strictly defined procedure, metrics that are linked to the performance of both channels and videos using YouTube Data API.

The present tool is a key part of my dissertation with the title "From digital footprints to facts: mining social data for marketing practices", through which conclusions are drawn for the Greek YouTube community in three areas:

- The behavior and preferences of the Greek Instagram & YouTube community 
- The tactics whereby businesses operate on Instagram and YouTube
- The impact of COVID-19 virus on digital behavior of the users
